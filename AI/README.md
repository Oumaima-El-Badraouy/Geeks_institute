# Recruiter Assistant (CLI) — Minimal

## Setup
1. Ensure Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Create folder `data/` and put provided `candidates.json`, `jobs.json`, `shortlists.json`.
3. Put `recruiter_assistant.py` in same folder (project root).
4. Run:

## Example prompts (copy/paste into the assistant CLI)
1. `Find 5 React interns in Casablanca, 0-2 years, available this month`
2. `Save #1 #3 as "FE-Intern-A"`
3. `Draft outreach email for "FE-Intern-A" using job "Frontend Intern"`
4. `Show analytics`

## Notes
- Shortlists are saved to `data/shortlists.json`.
- Email preview prints subject, plaintext and HTML (simple inline CSS).
- Simple scoring rules implemented per spec.

6) Example console run (simulated) — HTML preview printed

Hi Amina,

I’m reaching out because we have an opening for Frontend Intern. I looked at your profile and thought you could be a great fit.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute chat this week?
